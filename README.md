# FRC2020
FIRST FRC: Infinite Recharge Robot Code

---
#### Description:
FRC 2020 is the robot code that is flashed onto the [RoboRIO](https://www.ni.com/en-us/support/model.roborio.html) for the [FRC](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) competition. The robot needed the capabilities of accurate and high-speed turret maneuverability independant of the drive shaft, reliable cargo-loading with auto anti-jamming redundencies, and high-speed manuverability for on-ground performance.
